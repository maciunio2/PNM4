1. All installation MUST be proceeded as the same user that is going to use PNM!!!
   The reason is that we are going to remove old PNM4.rc file from "$HOME/.superkaramba" directory.
   It is important only when you install PNM4 for the first time,

2. Run the "install" file (it is in python, so just run it) with an argument:
    "l" for LEFT side of desktop
    "r" for RIGHT side of desktop
   i.e.: ./install r
   During the install process some necessary programs will be checked if they are present in the system. 
   (superkaramba, xwininfo, kdialog and kfmclient)
   This "install" script will generate the PNM4.theme file with necessary options like width, height etc.
   
3. DO NOT "configure;make;make install". Repeat - DO NOT DO THAT!

4. VERY IMPORTANT: After installation change the owner of whole PNM4 directory to the user which is going to use it! 
   (hint: 'chmod -R user.group PNM4')
  
5. If you have problems with proper displaying, try to set a variable auto_add_remove_plugins to 0 in PNM4.py file.
   You probably will have some problems on Gentoo.

6. Start your SuperKaramba with PNM4.theme file (i.e. "superkaramba /path/to/PNM/PNM4.theme")

7. Enjoy

:-)
