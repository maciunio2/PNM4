V.4.22 (24.08.2003)
    Small bugfix in line 270.
    
V.4,21 (24.08.2003)
    Added a possibility to enale/disable auto add/remove plugins dialog feature, due to some possible problems on Geentoo.
    To do:
    - find the reason of unnormal behaviour on Gentoo
    
V.4.20 (17.08.2003)
    Changed version number displayed in startup window.
    Added SuperKaramba presence checking in install file.
    
V.4.10 (03.08.2003)
    As it was written on TODO list the changes are as follows:
    - added the feature to install or remove plugins via kdialog menu (the kdialog program is required)
    - plugins to be installed are placed in ./plugins directory of main PNM dir, in *.tgz format
    - some changes in install script - now we are testing if all necessary programs are present (nothing woild be installed if all requirements were not fulfilled)
    
V.4.00 (30.07.2003)
    All the code was rewritten. Again :)
    SuperKaramba version 0.29 is REQUIRED for PNM to work.
    PNM 4.00 is now OBJECT-oriented. 
    As much as we know, this is the very first SuperKaramba project using "user objects".
    We have done some speed and optimization improovements.
    PNM now uses some of the new features from SK 0.29 like BackgroundImage, RichText, meterClicked etc.
    The proper "kfmclient" setting is required to use your browser for reading the news on web pages.
    "xwininfo" is required to install and use PNM 4.00 (needed to find out your screen resolution).

    Main changes:
    - full GNU GPL license (according to dot.gnu.org specification)
    - scrolling the logos up and down, to see more sites than 8
    - added the possibility to decide on which side of desktop the PNM would be installed (during the installation)
    - changed the PLUGINS structure - now all news uses one file feedparser.py located in main PNM4 directory
    - removed 2 arrows responsible for scrolling the news lines within main panel - now it is hard-limited up to 14 text lines
    - improoved the speed of zooming and "change-to-green" effects
    - added "start screen"
    - fixed a little bug with news link (it sometimes did not work)
    - fixed a bug with "x_uparrow, x_downarrow, arrows" not defined (thanx niq)

    Still to do in future releases:
    - autofit/resize all texts and images to the screen resolution "on-the-fly" (quite difficult)
    - autoinstall plugins from .tgz files
    
V.3.21 (10.07.2003)
    Some small test changes to use new attachClickArea and execute commands in the future releases.
    
V.3.20 (21.06.2003)
    *** WARNING *** - SuperKaramba 0.27 is REQUIRED to make PMN3.20 working.
    UNICODE!!! Yes, thanks to SK authors, the utf is supported, so we can get a pleasure from national fonts.
    A little bux-fix (for BSD* guys) - the header "/usr/bin/python" changed to "/usr/bin/env python" - you never know where the python is ;)
    Changed the way of background loading to use karamba new features - it speeds up the PNM3 a LOT.
    REMOVED almost all plugins from this package - to get more plugins, go to: http://www.kdelook.org/content/show.php?content=6534 
    
V.3.10 (07.06.2003)
    Changed the way of loading images (buttons and arrows). Improoved speed and lowered CPU usage.
    Repaired a bug in displaing news when there is no news. It caused a theme to loop and hang up.
    Added new sites:
    linuxweb.linuxindex.pl
    www.medialink.pl
    www.linuxfan.pl
    www.foto.magicshop.pl
    
V.3.00 (31.05.2003)
    Rewritten all the code from the beggining, to make it more efficient. 
    Added "zooming" icons in button menu, changing color of news when "mouse over" and clicked.
    More infos on actions taken (Loading, Updating etc.)
    The data is downloaded only during initialisation of theme and after pressing "Reload" button.
    Added scroll buttons in button menu - it is now possible to have as many plugins as wanted.
    Added scroll buttons in news panel - you can scroll the news if there is more than 13 of them on one panel.
    Moved the panel to right edge of screen and made it sliding.
    Added "install" file to get some initial data and to create PNM3.theme file.
    Added new panel Plugins:
    www.wp.pl
    www.rwo.pl
    www.idg.pl
    www.rp.pl
    media.netpr.pl

    Added JabberPl.org content
    
V.2.00 (22.05.2003)
    This version is acctually a new module. 
    It was totally rewritten to python. 
    The only perl parts are inside "plugins" directories (script getNews and others)
    The module consists now of only one panel, which slides out to the left of the screen.
    Each news site has its own icon. Clicking on it opens the news from particular site.
    The module is easy to expand with new sites. Read the PLUGIN_README to know the way of adding new sites.
    There are some minor bugs like wrong encoding of polish fonts. We are working on it.
    
V.1.22 (17.05.2003)
